orginal_text = """In this program, we will try to convert a given string 
to a list, where spaces or any other special  
characters, according to the users choice, are encountered. 
To do this we use the split() method in string. The split method is
used to split the strings and store them in the list. The built-in 
method returns a list of the words in the string, using the  
as the delimiter string. If a delimiter is not specified or is None, a 
different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace 
are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty 
strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace.
This task can be performed using regular expression. We can use the pattern 
to match all the alphabet and make list with all the matched elements.
